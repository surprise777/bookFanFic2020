3. Brief Walkthrough(existing pages)

    - Signup
    - Book Detail
    - Review Detail
    - Search Result
    - Profile Page(for both user and admin)

4. Postman
    There are multiple routes set up in ./routes, including /user/login, /book/addBook etc. They are successfully connected into our project but can be used to test functionalities except:
        PATCH http://localhost:5000/user/makeAdmin
            body(JSON): {
                "userId": 
            }
        since users are not supposed to see this in our project.
    We recommend to use postman for testing, say if there is a bad request when writing a review into our system.
    

5. Database schemas
    Our team used 4 schemas in this project: "book", "comment", "review", "user". More details(restrictions and default values) can be found in ./models.
